skip LF in CRLF.
VT: convert LF to CR

convert character to key event -- look up scan code for current input key layout and output cp
this can be: numpad, keyboard event (scancode)

keyboard event: press keys for modifiers, press key, release key, release modifiers

numpad event: alt down, keypad X, Y, Z, apt up

default mode:
these keys get stuffed directly into the input buffer
NOT DEDUPLICATED because they're pushed in in batch sizes > 1

virtual terminal input mode:
pasted content gets transformed by default through TerminalInput,
character by character.


thoughts-
stream.cpp converts alt-numpad events into characters again (i think)
stream.cpp passes through KeyDown in VT mode as just the character
