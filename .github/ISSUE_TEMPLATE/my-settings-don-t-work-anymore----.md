🛑 **STOP** 🛑

Do your settings not work anymore after updating to v0.11+?

In 0.11 we deprecated a number of old settings properties that we don't intend on maintaining in v1.0+.

There's a good chance the issue you're seeing is already described in [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/5458), [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-v0-11-release) or [this status update](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3600#issuecomment-608654738). 

If you've read the above and your issue is different, then go ahead and file a bug using our usual bug template:
